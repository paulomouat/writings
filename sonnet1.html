			<div class="stanza">
				Morning: So bright and warm it is today<br/>
				But brighter and warmer shines my love still;<br/>
				Upon the dewy mantle she does lay,<br/>
				Heavenly as a dream but indeed real.<br/>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				Among the blossoms of this meadow, green<br/>
				Of leaves and petals and a streaming brook<br/>
				She's the gentlest, for whose fragrance and sheen<br/>
				My heart has bloomed and I was swiftly took.<br/>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				Treading barefoot upon this hazy knoll,<br/>
				Lightly and merrily singing a song,<br/>
				My darling flower, she looks like a doll,<br/>
				A beauty in white, and for her I long.<br/>
			</div>
			<div class="couplet">
				My love is a rose, lovely and slender,<br/>
				My heart is her garden, wide and tender.<br/>
			</div>
